# Fantastic Umbrella - Week 13 Challenge

## Description
The goal of this project is to build the back-end for an e-commerce site. As a user working in the command-line, I can view the Categories, Products, and Tags of the seeded information. I can also search for one specifically, add one, update one, or delete one. This follows the CRUD methodology.

## Testing
By running the routes in Insomnia, you can get info, post, put, or delete.
